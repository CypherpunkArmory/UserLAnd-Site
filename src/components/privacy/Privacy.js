          <h1>USERLAND PRIVACY POLICY</h1>

          <p>UserLAnd Technologies, LLC (“UserLAnd”) believes in the importance of thoughtfully handling personal information and is committed to privacy practices that are transparent and compliant. This Privacy Policy sets out how UserLAnd uses the personal information we collect and receive about you from both visits to the website and through the use of the UserLAnd application.</p>

          <h3>Types of Personal Information</h3>
          <p>UserLAnd collects personal information from visitors to the website and users of the application to improve and optimize our services. This personal information is collected through a variety of ways. For example, when using the application we collect personal information through the registration and use of our software, whether users use the trial version or the paid version. We also collect personal information when you use or visit UserLAnd websites, opt-in to share the application data with our cloud services, or participate in a UserLAnd community.</p>

          <p>The type of information we collect will depend on your interactions with UserLAnd. It may include:</p>

            <li>Payment Information. Credit card number, banking information and billing address.</li>
            <li>Usage Data. UserLAnd collects aggregated, non-personally identifiable usage data related to your use of our products, services and websites so that we can analyze and improve delivery of our services. In some instances, UserLAnd may provide administrative functionality that allows you to opt out of the collection of some usage data.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Usage data may include information about your computer&apos;s or mobile device&apos;s operating system and browser type, device type, details about how you are using our products (but not including the underlying data), view your Internet Protocol (IP) address, geographic areas derived from your IP address, networking connection data, UserLAnd cookie information, file information, metadata, time stamped logs regarding access times and duration of visits, and other usage data relating to your activities on our Sites, including the pages you request. We may link this information to the personal information you provide for purposes described in this Privacy Policy, and may provide targeted product information back to users based on their user data.</p>

          <p>If you decline to provide your required personal information or ask us to delete it in compliance with the GDPR, we may be unable to continue to provide or support our products or services.</p>

          <h3>Uses of Personal Information</h3>

For example, it is in our legitimate interests to use your personal information to improve our products and services; to tell you about changes to this Privacy Policy and other policies; to tell you about new products, services and events or changes to our products, services or websites; for business reasons (for example to develop and expand our business); and to tell you about offers or promotions we are running; or</li>
            <li>If it is necessary for us to use your personal information in order to comply with legal process.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Sharing of Personal Information</h3>
          <p>UserLAnd works to keep your personal information confidential and secure, and does not sell your personal data. In some circumstances UserLAnd may share your information with third parties, for example:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>We may share your personal information when we have your express consent;</li>
            <li>If you connect to your third party accounts through our products, we will use that information to authenticate you, enumerate the data sources available to you, download any data you request us to, and download and refresh authentication tokens or persist authentication information such as user names and passwords as necessary to continue to connect to these data;</li>
            <li>We may share your personal information with parent and subsidiary companies, joint ventures, or other companies under common control, in which case we will require our affiliates to honor the terms of this Privacy Policy;</li>
            <li>We will disclose your personal information to comply with legal requirements, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We also may disclose your personal information in response to a law enforcement agency&apos;s request, or where we believe it is necessary to investigate, verify, prevent, enforce compliance with, or take action regarding illegal or suspected illegal activities; suspected fraud; situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person; protection of the rights and property of UserLAnd, our agents, customers, or others; violations or suspected violations of our agreements and policies; or as otherwise required or permitted by law or consistent with legal requirements; or</li>
            <li>We transfer or disclose your personal information for corporate reasons.

          </ul>
          <h3>Storage and Security of Your Personal Information</h3>
          <p>UserLAnd maintains reasonable and appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures in place to help safeguard your personal information. However, you should know that no company, including UserLAnd, can fully eliminate security risks associated with personal information. To help protect yourself, use a strong password, do not use the same passwords to access your UserLAnd accounts that you use with other accounts or services, and protect your user names and passwords to help prevent others from accessing your accounts and services.</p>

          <p>Information collected by UserLAnd may be stored on your computers, on your mobile devices, or on our servers if you provide consent, and may be transferred to, accessed from, or stored and processed in, the United States. However, we will protect all personal information we obtain in accordance with this Privacy Policy and take reasonable steps to ensure that the information  is treated lawfully. In certain circumstances we may retain your personal information after you have closed your account or are no longer actively engaged with UserLAnd. For example:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>We may retain your personal information after you have closed your account so that we can send you information about products, services and publications we think you may be interested in. You can &quot;unsubscribe&quot; to receiving such messages or tell us you are no longer interested;</li>
            <li>We may retain your personal information in order to protect our legal rights, or those of third parties, or to comply with the law; and</li>
            <li>We may retain personal information about how you have used our products and services in order to improve and develop our business.</li>
            <li>If you purchase products or services from us, we may retain your personal information for as long as we need to in order to provide you with customer service, or for compliance purposes, for example, in order to comply with our record keeping requirements.</li>
          </ul>
