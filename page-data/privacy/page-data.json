Furthermore, the European directives and regulations grant the data subject access to the following information:\nthe purposes of the processing;\nthe categories of personal information concerned;\nthe recipients or categories of recipients to whom the personal information have been or will be disclosed, in particular recipients in third countries or international organizations;\nwhere possible, the envisaged period for which the personal information will be stored, or, if not possible, the criteria used to determine that period;\nthe existence of the right to request from the controller rectification or erasure of personal information, or restriction of processing of personal information concerning the data subject, or to object to such processing;\nthe existence of the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority;\nwhere the personal information are not collected from the data subject, any available information as to their source;\nthe existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, referred to in Article 22(1) and (4) of the GDPR and, at least in those cases, meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the data subject has the right to obtain information as to whether personal information are transferred to a third country or to an international organization. Where this is the case, the data subject shall have the right to be informed of the appropriate safeguards relating to the transfer.</p>\n<p>If a data subject wishes to exercise this right of access, he or she may at any time contact our Data Protection Officer or another employee of the controller.</p>\n<p>Right to Rectify.\nEach data subject has the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller without undue delay the rectification of inaccurate personal information concerning him or her. Taking into account the purposes of the processing, the data subject shall have the right to have incomplete personal information completed, including by means of providing a supplementary statement.</p>\n<p>If a data subject wishes to exercise this right to rectification, they may, at any time, contact our Data Protection Officer or another employee of the controller.</p>\n<p>Right to Erasure.\nEach data subject has the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal information concerning him or her without undue delay, and the controller shall have the obligation to erase personal information without undue delay where one of the following grounds applies, as long as the processing is not necessary:\nThe personal information are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed.\nThe data subject withdraws consent to which the processing is based according to point (a) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, or point (a) of Article 9(2) of the GDPR, and where there is no other legal ground for the processing.\nThe data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(1) of the GDPR and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing, or the data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(2) of the GDPR.\nThe personal information has been unlawfully processed.\nThe personal information must be erased for compliance with a legal obligation in Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject.\nThe personal information has been collected in relation to the offer of information society services referred to in Article 8(1) of the GDPR.</p>\n<p>If one of the aforementioned reasons applies, and a data subject wishes to request the erasure of personal information stored by the Controller, he or she may at any time contact our Data Protection Officer or another employee of the controller. The Data Protection Officer of Controller or another employee shall promptly ensure that the erasure request is complied with immediately.</p>\n<p>Right of restriction of processing.\nEach data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller restriction of processing where one of the following applies: The accuracy of the personal information is contested by the data subject, for a period enabling the controller to verify the accuracy of the personal information. The processing is unlawful and the data subject opposes the erasure of the personal information and requests instead the restriction of their use instead. The controller no longer needs the personal information for the purposes of the processing, but they are required by the data subject for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims. The data subject has objected to processing pursuant to Article 21(1) of the GDPR pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of the controller override those of the data subject.</p>\n<p>Right to Portability.\nEach data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator, to receive the personal information concerning him or her, which was provided to a controller, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. He or she shall have the right to transmit those data to another controller without hindrance from the controller to which the personal information has been provided, as long as the processing is based on consent pursuant to point (a) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR or point (a) of Article 9(2) of the GDPR, or on a contract pursuant to point (b) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, and the processing is carried out by automated means, as long as the processing is not necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, in exercising his or her right to data portability pursuant to Article 20(1) of the GDPR, the data subject shall have the right to have personal information transmitted directly from one controller to another, where technically feasible and when doing so does not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.</p>\n<p>In order to assert the right to data portability, the data subject may at any time contact the Data Protection Officer designated by Company or another employee.</p>\n<p>Right to Object.\nEach data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to object, on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, at any time, to processing of personal information concerning him or her, which is based on point (e) or (f) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR. This also applies to profiling based on these provisions.</p>\n<p>This data controller shall no longer process the personal information in the event of the objection, unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject, or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.</p>\n<p>Right to withdraw data protection consent.\nEach data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to withdraw his or her consent to processing of his or her personal information at any time.</p>\n<p>If the data subject wishes to exercise the right to withdraw consent, he or she may at any time directly contact our Data Protection Officer or another employee of the controller.</p>\n<h3>Provision of personal information as statutory or contractual requirement; Requirement necessary to enter into a contract; Obligation of the data subject to provide the personal information; possible consequences of failure to provide such data</h3>\n<p>We clarify that the provision of personal information is partly required by law (e.g. tax regulations) or can also result from contractual provisions (e.g. information on the contractual partner). Sometimes it may be necessary to conclude a contract that the data subject provides us with personal information, which must subsequently be processed by us. The data subject is, for example, obliged to provide us with some personal information when our company signs a contract with him or her. The non-provision of the personal information would have the consequence that the contract with the data subject could not be concluded. Before personal information is provided by the data subject, in this circumstance the data subject must contact our Data Protection Officer. Our Data Protection Officer clarifies to the data subject whether the provision of the personal information is required by law or contract or is necessary for the conclusion of the contract, whether there is an obligation to provide the personal information and the consequences of non-provision of the personal information.</p>\n<h3>Legal Basis for Data Processing</h3>\n<p>Art. 6(1) lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing operations for which we obtain consent for a specific processing purpose. If the processing of personal information is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the information subject is party, as is the case, for example, when processing operations are necessary for the supply of goods or to provide any other service, the processing is based on Article 6(1) lit. b GDPR. The same applies to such processing operations which are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of inquiries concerning our products or services. If our company is subject to a legal obligation by which processing of personal information is required, such as for the fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6(1) lit. c GDPR. In rare cases, the processing of personal information may be necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person. Then the processing would be based on Art. 6(1) lit. d GDPR. Finally, processing operations could be based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR. This legal basis is used for processing operations which are not covered by any of the aforementioned legal grounds, if processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by our company or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal information. Such processing operations are particularly permissible because they have been specifically mentioned by the European legislator. He considered that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the data subject is a client of the controller (Recital 47 Sentence 2 GDPR).</p>\n<h2>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h2>\n<p>BY USING THIS WEBSITE AND/OR SERVICES, YOU AGREE THAT YOU AS THE DATA SUBJECT CONSENT TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY.
